1) Still need to add --save flag as said in the subject, currently that will just return a 'too many arguments error'. Also dont resize resx and resy in this case?


2) revisit the ft_overlaysprite function for simplifications.

3) Quite slow on large resolutions, need to see if I can speed it up.


4) Check all the errors are still being flagged as errors.

5) Go through the subject pdf again when you think youre finished

6) Check leaks

7) Run Norme on everything
