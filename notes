1) Might want to make it able to read multiple elements on the same line (which it won't do for paths atm). If we can assume that all textures end in .bmp or .png this is doable however.

2) Still need to add --save flag as said in the subject, currently that will just return a 'too many arguments error'. Also dont resize resx and resy in this case?

3) Could write the printf-heavy debug function in a norm approved way using write and punter etc, and maybe include it as a runnable function using a '--debug' flag or something. That could help explain why my program rejects  .cub file if an evaluator uses a faulty one during the eval.

4) Need to handle spaces between the individual parts of map elements

5) Need to update makefile rules, make re etc.

6) Check if you can trigger an error with a valid .cub file by leaving it in a directory and telling the program it is located at "that_dir/*", shouldnt be an error, but might be in my current setup.

7) See if you can trick it to read a '.cub' directory

8) Perhaps return specific error message if .png file was passed.

9) Unmirror south and east textures, figure out why they are being mirrored in the first place

10) Quite slow on large resolutions, need to see if I can speed it up.

11) Go through the subject pdf again when you think youre finished

12) Run Norme on everything
