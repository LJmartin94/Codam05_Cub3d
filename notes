1) Might want to make it able to read multiple elements on the same line (which it won't do for paths atm). If we can assume that all textures end in .bmp or .png this is doable however.

2) Need to handle spaces between the individual parts of map elements

3) Perhaps return specific error message if .png file was passed.

4) Could write the printf-heavy debug function in a norm approved way using write and punter etc, and maybe include it as a runnable function using a '--debug' flag or something. That could help explain why my program rejects  .cub file if an evaluator uses a faulty one during the eval.


5) Handle window management properly (x closes window and program)

6) Still need to add --save flag as said in the subject, currently that will just return a 'too many arguments error'. Also dont resize resx and resy in this case?


7) revisit the ft_overlaysprite function for simplifications.

8) Quite slow on large resolutions, need to see if I can speed it up.


9) Check all the errors are still being flagged as errors.

10) Go through the subject pdf again when you think youre finished

11) Run Norme on everything
