Might want to make it able to read multiple elements on the same line (which it won't do for paths atm). If we can assume that all textures end in .bmp or .png this is doable however.

Still need to add --save flag as said in the subject, currently that will just return a 'too many arguments error'

Could write the printf-heavy debug function in a norm approved way using write and punter etc, and maybe include it as a runnable function using a '--debug' flag or something. That could help explain why my program rejects  .cub file if an evaluator uses a faulty one during the eval.

Minimum Resolution is currently 1x1, this should probably be larger but I don't know what size is realistic yet.

Need to make sure rex and resy in struct are scaled down to screens max res if they are larger than screen max res
