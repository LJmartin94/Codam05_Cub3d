Might want to make it able to read multiple elements on the same line (which it won't do for paths atm). If we can assume that all textures end in .bmp or .png this is doable however.

Still need to add --save flag as said in the subject, currently that will just return a 'too many arguments error'. Also dont resize resx and resy in this case?

Could write the printf-heavy debug function in a norm approved way using write and punter etc, and maybe include it as a runnable function using a '--debug' flag or something. That could help explain why my program rejects  .cub file if an evaluator uses a faulty one during the eval.

Minimum Resolution is currently 1x1, this should probably be larger but I don't know what size is realistic yet.

Need to handle spaces between the individual parts of map elements

In ft_raycaster, wedelta is infinite if facing north or south, and nsdelta is infinite if facing west or east
