Done but I'll do it again:
Check for printf statements
Run Norme on everything
Check all the errors are still being flagged as errors.


check for leaks with leaks on iMac
check to see if bmps are flipped on iMac
check to see if bmps have the right meta-data on iMacs
check to see if you can do anything crazy with the window management on iMacs


3) Go through the subject pdf again when you think youre finished

Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separatedby one or more space(s).


4) Check leaks

5) Clean up Makefile comments

6) Run Norme and Norminette Plus on everything (including Makefile)

7) PUSH YOUR GIT REPO TO YOUR SCHOOL REPO (except testermaps folder)
